Hello, 

*Here you can find a folder named data with all datasets you submitted (clicks and users folders) and new datasests created as asked: 

total_clicks.csv - Task#1

filtered_clicks.csv - Task#2.

*You will also find attached file 'Data Engineering Academy Homework.ipynb'.

*Datasets were prepared using Python-Jupyter Notebook. However it's saved locally, so I prepared it on anaconda.cloud so you can run it and make sure everything works as expected. Anaconda doesn't yet have the ability to directly share Jupyter Notebook (they're working on it), so I'm giving you access to my new account. Don't worry, there is no personal information :), it was created just for this academy. All files and directories are named the same.
